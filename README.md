In this modern world anesthesia is an important drug that must administrated to a patients during surgery . Propofol and Ephedrine are the anesthetic agents that must be administrated to a patient  before surgery change in dosage level may lead to risk in patient body and figuring out right amount may frequently depend on experience of the anesthesiologist . To overcome this a model is build to predict anesthesia dosage and hypotension using bi directional long short term memory . In this project two deep learning architectures LSTM and BI-LSTM has been assessed and compared .Data set consist of histrocial patient data such as vital signs and previous dosage to make accurate predictions. Data preprocessing consist of Data cleaning,Data standardization,Normalization and Feature engineering .The Bi-LSTm had an accuracy of 100% where LSTM had only 57% of accuracy Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall ,mean squared error and mean absolute error where used to assess the model.The end goal is to provide clinicans a tool that could predict optimial anesthesia level and hypotension prediction , improving patients safety during surgery.
